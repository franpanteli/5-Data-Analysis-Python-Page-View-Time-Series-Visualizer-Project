# Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer) in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this which used pandas, seaborn and matplotlib to produce plots - by analysing time series data for visitations to a website.

### Workflow
#### Task Brief
Notes on the task brief for this project were first written, which are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). The project boilerplate files were next cloned in a Gitpod environment. This included CSV data involving time series data for the number of visitations made to a website ([fcc-forum-pageviews.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/fcc-forum-pageviews.csv)). Python was desired which produced three output plots for this data. Three aim plots were provided for this, which are in the [Aim](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Aim) directory in this repository and also given below.

#### Writing The Project time_series_visualizer.py File

The `draw_line_plot`, `draw_bar_plot` and `draw_box_plot` functions were coded into the project [time_series_visualizer.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/time_series_visualizer.py) file, to generate plots of this nature using the time series input data. This file was annotated with problem-solving approaches to produce plotting functions for this. These performed calculations on the project data and generated the plots in the [Output Files](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Output%20Files) directory. These output plots are also provided below.

#### Submission & Testing
Project files were pushed to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/main.py)) had successfully passed and its URL was submitted. This aided in developing statistical and data analytics skills with NumPy and marked the completion of the fourth project in the course as part of my independent problem solving work.
