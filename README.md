# Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer) in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this which used pandas, seaborn and matplotlib to produce plots - by analysing time series data for visitations to a website.

### Workflow
Notes on the task brief for this project were first written, which are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). The project boilerplate files were next cloned in a Gitpod environment. This included CSV data involving time series data for the number of visitations made to a website ([fcc-forum-pageviews.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/fcc-forum-pageviews.csv)). Python was desired which produced three output plots for this data. Three aim plots were provided for this, which are in the [Aim](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Aim) directory in this repository and are below. <img width="1036" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-01 at 14 38 35" src="https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/assets/131474705/47d0f4cb-ca47-416f-a2df-091588f44402">![Figure_2](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/assets/131474705/2bfcc033-b94a-46dd-8493-194619cdca33)![Figure_3](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/assets/131474705/73130fe8-5e90-4c71-a567-1ff2b7227d9f)
The `draw_line_plot`, `draw_bar_plot` and `draw_box_plot` functions were next coded into the project [time_series_visualizer.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/time_series_visualizer.py) file, to generate plots of this nature using the time series input data. This file was annotated with problem-solving approaches to produce plotting functions for this. These performed calculations on the project data and generated the plots in the [Output Files](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Page-View-Time-Series-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Output%20Files) directory. Project files were pushed to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/py%20Files/main.py)) had successfully passed and its URL was submitted. This aided in developing statistical and data analytics skills with Numpy and marked the completion of the third project in the course.
