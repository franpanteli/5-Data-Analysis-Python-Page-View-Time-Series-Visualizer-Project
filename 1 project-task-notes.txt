These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Page View Time Series Visualizer." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer

- Clone the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment 
- There are courses which need to be completed before starting the project 
	-> Python for Everybody Video Course (14 hours) <- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/
	-> How to Analyze Data with Python Pandas (10 hours) <- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-analyze-data-with-python-pandas/

- Time series data:
	-> We are given data which shows the number of times people have viewed a page 
	-> We are making line charts, bar charts and box plots for this -> to show the number of people who have viewed the page per unit of time 
	-> The page is the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03
	-> We are provided the data

- Tasks:
	-> We are importing the data from fcc-forum-pageviews.csv 
		-> While we do this, we set the index to the `date` column 
		-> Cleaning the data:
			-> We are getting rid of extreme values 
			-> When page views were in the top or bottom 2.5% of the dataset 

		-> Creating the draw_line_plot function <- LINE PLOT PLOTTING FUNCTION
			-> This is a plotting function which draws a line chart 
			-> The title of this should be `Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019`
			-> The label on the x axis should be `Date`
			-> The label on the y axis should be `Page Views`

		-> Creating the draw_bar_plot function <- BAR PLOT PLOTTING FUNCTION
			-> This should show the average daily page views 
			-> We are given the aim outputs for this 
			-> The legend should show moth labels and have a title of `Months`
			-> The label on the x axis should be `Years`
			-> The label on the y axis should be `Average Page Views`

		-> Creating the draw_box_plot function <- BOX PLOT PLOTTING FUNCTION
			-> Showing how the values are distributed in a given year or month 
			-> This is a second plotting function 
			-> We are drawing two separate box plots 
			-> There is a left one and a right one 
				-> The title of the left one should be `Year-wise Box Plot (Trend)` and the title of the right one should be `Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality)`
				-> We are showing how these values are distributed over time 
				-> The month labels need to start at January 

		-> For each chart: 
			-> We want to use a copy of the data frame 
			-> The boilerplate includes commands to save and return the image
			-> time_series_visualizer.py <- Where we write the main Python
			-> main.py <- For development 
			-> test_module.py <- This file contains Python test modules
